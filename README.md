## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

- Clone the repository to your home directory and open a terminal inside it:

   ```shell
   cd ~
   git clone <url>
   cd <name>
   ```

- Enable flakes:

   ```shell
   sudo sed -i '/^}$/i\  nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];' /etc/nixos/configuration.nix

   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

- See [hosts](./hosts) for the list of `<host>` possibilities and then setup the current system hardware for it:

   ```shell
   sudo nixos-generate-config --dir ./hosts/<host>
   ```

- Replace the home config for the new user and replace all appearances of the existing username with a new one:

   ```shell
   mv ./modules/home-manager/dy0gu.nix ./modules/home-manager/<username>.nix

   find . -path ./\.git -prune -o -type f -exec sed -i 's/dy0gu/<username>/g' {} +
   ```

   If you want to add new users and not just replace the default one, then add them in [modules/core/users.nix](./modules/core/users.nix) file and create the respective [modules/home-manager](./modules/home-manager) config. This user config should then be loaded it in the `flake.nix` file for the desired `<host>`.

- Build and switch to the same `<host>` from the previous hardware configuration step:

   ```shell
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>
   ```

## Usage üöÄ

This setup is made to not keep any sort of credentials or personal data in the repository, meaning SSH keys, passwords, git auth etc. should be added manually after the initial setup.

- First, and most important, don't forget to change the initial password for the default user:

   ```shell
   sudo passwd <username>
   ```

   You don't need to do this step if the user already had a password set before the initial `nixos-rebuild switch` command, as it will not be overwritten by the initial password configuration.
